How ready you are to start new step in your career's Path 
I absolutely ready to kick off this new phase of my career. I have set up goals to prioritize continual improvement, I have bookmarked some sites suggested during the course of the program and I have met great colleagues who will be my collaborators now that the course is over.

Any thought that you want to talk about especially the skills you gain during the Bootcamp.

I have gained multiple skills in a very short period of 6 months but, I intend to further hone all the skills learnt so far by intentionally setting time apart for private and collaborative study.
